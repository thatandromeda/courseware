                <p>
                  The idea of data types covers two things:

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What an object <em>is</em> -- strings are actually
                    different sorts of things than numbers;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What you can <em>do with it</em>.  Addition is a thing you 
                    can only do with numbers and concatenation is a thing you
                    can only do with strings, even though we referred to both
                    of them above as "+".

                  A couple of things that will be important if you work with other
                  languages, and/or if you really like nerdy details.
      
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Languages don't always use the same names for their data types, but
                      there are some you'll find in just about every language even
                      if their names differ.  Strings are ubiquitous. So are numbers -
                      although Javascript just has one numeric type, <code>Number</code>,
                      whereas some languages have several types representing different
                      types of numbers (e.g. Python's <code>int</code>, for integers,
                      and <code>float</code>, for numbers which may have fractional
                      parts).  Lots of languages have a data type representing key/value
                      pairs, but Javascript's is called an <code>associative array</code>
                      and Python's is called a <code>dict</code> (short for "dictionary",
                      your favorite key-value pair in everyday life).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Key takeaway: don't get too hung up on what the types are called
                      (and be prepared to look for new terminology if you study a
                      different language). But do understand the core ideas of what a
                      data type is and what kinds are out there - you'll see those ideas
                      in every language.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Languages let you define your own data types, too. If you needed
                      to have a data type "MARC record" that was allowed to have fields
                      with certain properties, and that had functions like "update"
                      but didn't have functions like "+" (because what would it even
                      mean to "+" two MARC records)? You could do that.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Languages vary in how up-front they are with you about the
                      existence of data types, and how much they make you deal with the
                      data type machinery.  This is good and bad!  For instance,
                      Javascript lets you define a new variable without defining its
                      data type (not all languages do this).  This makes it much simpler
                      to get started, and often faster to write. On the other hand, you
                      and the computer might end up disagreeing about what kind of
                      data is in your variable, to unpredictable results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      My favorite language is Python, which hides a lot of the data
                      type machinery - I feel like the language gets out of my way and
                      just does what I mean to a remarkable extent.  My husband much
                      prefers C, because its strong typing system keeps him from making
                      (certain kinds of) mistakes, especially in complex codebases too
                      large to understand in their entirety.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

          <!-- begin indexOf() -->
          <div>
            <h3>Indexing, programmer-style</h3>
            
            <p>
              One function you can use on strings (but not on numbers!)
              is <code>indexOf()</code>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This function operates on a string and takes one argument,
              another string.  It tells you where (or if) the argument 
              first occurs in your string.  So for example:
            </p>
<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  'jQuery'.indexOf('Q');
</code>
</pre>
            <p>
              What got returned when you typed that?
            </p>
          
            <p>
              A very important thing to notice here is that programmers
              can't count.  Most programming languages are what's called
              <mark>zero-indexed</mark>: that means that, when you are
              counting what position you're at in a string (or other list of
              values), you start at 0.  In the string <code>jQuery</code>,
              <code>j</code> is in the 0th position, <code>Q</code> is in
              the 1st position, and so forth.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is easy to end up with so-called <mark>off-by-one
              errors</mark> when programming, and everyone has.  If you're
              writing code that's counting things, slicing them, etc., and
              it's not doing quite what you expect, check for this.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Okay, let's try some other examples:
            </p>

<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  'jQuery'.indexOf('ry');

  'Mississippi'.indexOf('i');

  'Mississippi'.indexOf('q');

  'jQuery'.indexOf('q');
</code>
</pre>
          <p>
            What was up with those?
          </p>

          <p>
            We'll be using <code>indexOf()</code> a lot, so make sure you have
            a good handle on how it behaves.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            You've probably noticed by now that programmers don't use the word
            <mark>index</mark> in the same way librarians do, although the
            meanings are related.  Instead of being a collection of things
            you might find in a text and the page numbers for where you'd find
            them, an index is just the number of the location where you'd
            find a thing.  I might talk about <mark>indexing into</mark>
            a string or a variable - that means looking at a particular
            location in that string or variable, as dictated by the index.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            By the way, you can go in the reverse direction, too &mdash; if
            you have an index and a string, you can find out what character
            is at that index in the string.  What do you think these will
            return?
          </p>
<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  'jQuery'[0]

  'jQuery'[1]

  'jQuery'[6]
</code>
</pre>
            <p>
              Did they do what you expected?
            </p>

            <div class="question-time clearfix">
          </div>
          <!-- end indexOf() -->
          
          <!-- begin arrays -->
          <div>
            <h3>A what? Array!</h3>
            
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-9">
                <p>
                  Another data type that's good to know, now that we know about
                  indexes, is <code>array</code>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  An array is a list of ...stuff. Any kind of stuff! The
                  stuff can be of type string, or type number, or any other
                  data type you have lying around.  The different items on
                  the list don't even have to be of the same type (though
                  usually they are).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Arrays are ubiquitous in programming because the real
                  world is full of lists of stuff.  Your ILS contains, in a
                  sense, a gigantic list of MARC records (and another
                  gigantic list of patron records, and another of transaction
                  records, et cetera).  It's just a handy mental model when
                  we need to keep track of lots of things. As we'll see later,
                  it's also handy when we need to <em>do stuff</em> to lots
                  of things.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-3 well">
                <em>Side note!</em>
                <p>
                  I might accidentally call arrays "lists", because that's
                  what they're called in Python, which is what I usually
                  program in. You can upbraid me if it confuses you.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>
              Here's an example array:
            </p>
<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  var courseDataTypes = ['string', 'number', 'array', 'boolean']
</code>
</pre>
            <p>
              Important things to note:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The array begins with a <code>[</code> and ends with a
                <code>]</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Its elements are separated by commas.
              </li>
              <li>
                Arrays stay in order.  If we looked at
                <code>courseDataTypes</code> later, <code>'string'</code>
                would still be first and <code>'boolean'</code> would still
                be last.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              If you want to access individual elements of an array, you
              do so with the same indexing you saw above (remember, 
              zero-based!).  What will these lines return?
            </p>
<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  courseDataTypes[0]

  courseDataTypes[1]

  courseDataTypes[2]

  courseDataTypes[3]
</code>
</pre>
          </div>
          <!-- end arrays -->

          <!-- begin split() -->
          <div>
            <h3>Time to make a banana split</h3>
            
            <p>
              Now that we know about arrays, we can understand another
              useful function: <code>split()</code>. The <code>split()</code>
              function operates on strings and takes one argument: the 
              character at which you should split the list apart.  It returns 
              an array of all the substrings that were in between your
              separator character(s).  This'll be easier to see with an
              example:
            </p>
<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  'banana'.split('a')
</code>
</pre>
          <p>
            Can you explain what just happened there?
          </p>

          <p>
            Let's try a few more examples:
          </p>

<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  'banana'.split('n')

  'banana'.split('b')

  'banana'.split('an')

  'banana'.split('')

  'banana'.split('q')

  'banana'.split(2)
  
  var myBanana = 'banana'
  
  myBanana.split('a')
</code>
</pre>

          <p>
            As you have probably guessed, a useful programming technique,
            when you're not quite sure how something works, is to try out
            <mark>edge cases</mark>.  Look for places where the program
            might do something weird, and see what happens! This will 
            illuminate the details of its behavior (and whether they match
            what you expect).
          </p>

          <p>
            When you're writing your own programs, it's important to think
            through all the edge cases that your data or your users might 
            present you with, and be sure to handle them in some appropriate
            way. (Or, I should say, it's important to <em>try</em> to think
            them through; in practice you will probably miss some, 
            especially if your program has users other than yourself -
            users are so unpredictable! This is why it's important to test
            programs, and good if you can revisit and improve them over time.)
          </p>

            <p>
              We've seen our first three data types: <code>number</code>,
              <code>string</code>, and <code>array</code>. Another
              super-useful one is <code>boolean</code>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Go ahead and guess what two values a boolean variable can have.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Once you've guessed, try typing these in:
            </p>
<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  typeof(true)

  typeof(false)

  typeof(True)

  typeof(False)
</code>
</pre>
            <p>
              What's up with that?
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I tried to slip a new function by you there, so let's talk
              about that too. You probably have already guessed what it means
              (because descriptive variable &amp; function names are awesome),
              but let's make that explicit: what does <code>typeof()</code> do?
            </p>
            
            <p>
              There are other data types we won't be covering today; I'd 
              rather you understand a few things clearly than many things 
              poorly. Just be aware that they're out there, and you'll
              encounter them if you go further in programming.
            </p>

            <div class="question-time clearfix">

          <!-- end booleans -->

<!--
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALREADY INTRODUCED....
.css()
applying a jquery function to an entire selector - use same example.
"arguments"
"return"

Then you can take their definitions out of the functions page (or phrase them
as review)
-->

<!--
TO COVER THIS PAGE:
* Data types (in javascript, arrrgh)
  * reinforce variables
  * strings, numbers, booleans
    * not doing: arrays; objects
    * mention object, since they'll see it
    * (in python arrays=lists and objects=dicts)
* Booleans and if/then
