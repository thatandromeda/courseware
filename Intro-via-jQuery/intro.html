                    <span class="lead">It's okay not to know things.</span>
                    Some of you may have programmed before; some of you may
                    not have.  We're at different places on the journey, but all
                    of us started out not knowing anything about programming.
                    If you're struggling with something you haven't mastered
                    yet, that's OK. If you see someone struggling with something
                    you've mastered previously, don't feign surprise or take
                    over their keyboard.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <span class="lead">It's okay to have feelings.</span>
                    Programming can be really frustrating. Feeling frustrated
                    doesn't mean you're bad at it. It's okay to persevere
                    as long as it still feels productive, and get away from
                    the keyboard for a while when it doesn't. Programming
                    can be confusing. It can be scary, especially if you
                    don't see a lot of people like you (whatever that means to
                    you) among programmers.  It can also be joyful and 
                    thrilling when you build things that work!
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <span class="lead">We're all in this together.</span>
                    Programming in the real world is collaborative, and
                    learning the craft is profoundly social. So ask questions,
                    help people, and don't let anyone (including yourself!)
                    get excluded or left behind.  Need help?  Ask someone, or
                    put a sticky note on your laptop and someone will come
                    help. Seeing people who are stuck? Help out. And watch out
                    for subtle -isms (e.g. "it's so easy even your mom could 
                    do it"). They leave people out too.

            <h3>Finding your developer tools</h3>
            
            <p>
              Your browser has (or can quickly have) a special feature that
              lets you:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Examine the HTML structure of your page in depth;
              </li>
              <li>
                See (and mess around with) the CSS rules that apply to each
                element;
              </li>
              <li>
                Write and run JavaScript code.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Its name and location are different in different browsers;
              here are some examples. Spend a few minutes finding <em>your</em>
              developer tools. <strong>This is critical for the rest of the
              course</strong>, so if you're having trouble, put a sticky note
              on your computer and do not let the class go forward until
              you have gotten help. (Remember: we're not going to leave you
              behind.)
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I've given you instructions for all the browsers I have ready
              access to. You may have a different browser. If that's the
              case, here are some options:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Read the instructions for the most similar browser (as you
                will see, all the instructions are fairly similar, so
                your browser probably works similarly too);
              </li>
              <li>
                Google for (your browser) "developer tools";
              </li>
              <li>
                Ask one of your new friends for help;
              </li>
              <li>
                Put a sticky note on your laptop.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Please tell me what you come up with so I can improve these
              instructions.

            <p>
              Let's try typing some stuff in to our developer consoles to
              see how they work.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Start with this (anything in these big grey boxes is code to
              type in to your developer console, <em>exactly as it appears,
              including punctuation and capitalization</em>):
            </p>

<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  2 + 2
</code>
</pre>

          <p>
            Hopefully that did what you expected! If you didn't get 4, 
            summon help.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When you type a <mark>function</mark> into your console, 
            the console will tell you what it <mark>returns</mark>. Plus
            is a function: something that takes some input and produces some
            output.
          </p>

<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  var $j = jQuery.noConflict();
</code>
</pre>

            <p>
              You should see something like this:
            </p>
            <img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="img/undefined.png">
            
            <p>
              This is normal.  We gave the computer some input, but it
              doesn't have any immediate output for us - we didn't ask it
              to perform any functions - so the return value is
              <code>undefined</code>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              (Also your dev tools probably gave you some autocomplete
              options. You can use <mark>tab completion</mark> to make
              typing them super fast. Hooray!)
            </p>

            <p>
              So, uh....what <em>was</em> that input, exactly?
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <code>var</code> means, "let's define a variable".
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <code>$j</code> is the name of that variable. Looks kind of
              cryptic, but is a convention for jQuery, so let's go with it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <code>jQuery</code> is a library for Javascript.  Javascript
              is a programming language that powers a lot of the dynamic
              elements you see on web pages (and increasingly is used to
              power stuff behind the scenes, too).  A library is an
              extension which adds new functions to a language, giving it
              increased functionality or ease of use. jQuery does a couple
              of great things which, in my opinion, make it a good
              introduction to Javascript:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Its functions are named with nice English words that 
                describe what they do.  (Don't take this for granted! Lots
                of programs use cryptic variable and function names.) This
                helps you read code more fluently, even when it's new to you.
              </li>
              <li>
                It's been tested on a lot of browsers and operating systems,
                so code you write in jQuery is more likely to work for
                all of your users than code you write without it.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              <code>.noConflict()</code> means to use the noConflict function
              from the jQuery library (the period joins them because of
              this relationship between them). noConflict generates a new
              jQuery instance that is separate from any other jQuery 
              instances that might already be in use on the page &mdash;
              aka it doesn't conflict with them. This is nice because if
              several parts of your page use jQuery &mdash; say, code that
              you wrote and code from a vendor platform you're inserting
              it into &mdash; you don't want to run into accidental
              interactions that break stuff.  noConflict() isn't always 
              necessary, but conflicts are super hard to debug, so it's
              easiest to be in the habit of using it always.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Finally, the <code>;</code> at the end terminates the line.
              Not all Javascript lines need to end in semicolons, but some
              do, so again, it's easiest to be in the habit of using them
              unless you absolutely mustn't (we'll see an example later).
            </p>

            <p>
              Now let's type this in (remember, capitalization counts!):
            </p>

<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  var $j = jquery.noConflict();
</code>
</pre>

            <p>
              Doh.
            </p>

              Let's fix it. Press the up arrow - this will give you the last

              enter and see that it works again. Yay!
            </p>

            <div class="question-time clearfix"></div>
            
          </div>
          <!-- end using dev tools -->

            <p>
              Remember that <code>$j</code> thing? Let's do stuff with it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The basis of jQuery is that you select elements on your page
              &mdash; using exactly the same syntax you use for CSS
              selectors &mdash; and then you do stuff to them.  What will
              this select?
            </p>

<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  $j('div')
</code>
</pre>

            <p>
              (Hey, check out what happened in your console when you pressed
              enter! What's up with that?)
            </p>

            <p>
              Now let's do stuff to this stuff we just selected! Note again
              the period connecting the function to the $j variable. Remember
              that $j was a jQuery object; that means it gets to use all the
              functions in the jQuery library.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In jQuery, we often do stuff by adding or removing CSS classes,
              allowing our CSS rules to do the heavy lifting. What do you
              suppose this will do?
            </p>

<pre>
<code class="code-big">
  $j('div').addClass('white-text');
</code>
</pre>
            <div class="reveal">
              <p>
                Here is an awesome thing about programming. If you don't like
                what the program did, you can usually undo your work. Let's
                reload the page now.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <p>
              The classes we will primarily be adding and removing are
              classes I defined (you can see them in custom.css) that 
              affect the background colors of objects.  Those classes are:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>bg-purple</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>bg-yellow</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>bg-orange</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>bg-green</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>bg-lavender</code>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              They do what you'd expect:
            </p>
