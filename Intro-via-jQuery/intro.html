                    <span class="lead">It's okay not to know things.</span>
                    Some of you may have programmed before; some of you may
                    not have.  We're at different places on the journey, but all
                    of us started out not knowing anything about programming.
                    If you're struggling with something you haven't mastered
                    yet, that's OK. If you see someone struggling with something
                    you've mastered previously, don't feign surprise or take
                    over their keyboard.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <span class="lead">It's okay to have feelings.</span>
                    Programming can be really frustrating. Feeling frustrated
                    doesn't mean you're bad at it. It's okay to persevere
                    as long as it still feels productive, and get away from
                    the keyboard for a while when it doesn't. Programming
                    can be confusing. It can be scary, especially if you
                    don't see a lot of people like you (whatever that means to
                    you) among programmers.  It can also be joyful and 
                    thrilling when you build things that work!
                  </p>

                    <span class="lead">We don't leave anyone behind.</span>
                    Feeling stuck? Put a sticky note on your laptop and someone
                    will come help. Seeing people who are stuck? Help out.
                    And watch out for subtle -isms (e.g. "it's so easy even your 
                    mom could do it"). They leave people behind too.

            <h3>Your developer tools</h3>
            
            <p>
              Your browser has (or can quickly have) a special feature that
              lets you:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Examine the HTML structure of your page in depth;
              </li>
              <li>
                See (and mess around with) the CSS rules that apply to each
                element;
              </li>
              <li>
                Write and run JavaScript code.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Its name and location are different in different browsers;
              here are some examples. Spend a few minutes finding <em>your</em>
              developer tools. <strong>This is critical for the rest of the
              course</strong>, so if you're having trouble, put a sticky note
              on your computer and do not let the class go forward until
              you have gotten help. (Remember: we're not going to leave you
              behind.)
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I've given you instructions for all the browsers I have ready
              access to. You may have a different browser. If that's the
              case, here are some options:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Read the instructions for the most similar browser (as you
                will see, all the instructions are fairly similar, so
                your browser probably works similarly too);
              </li>
              <li>
                Google for (your browser) "developer tools";
              </li>
              <li>
                Ask one of your new friends for help;
              </li>
              <li>
                Put a sticky note on your laptop.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Please tell me what you come up with so I can improve these
              instructions.

* Selectors, binding, just enough events (only use click for now)
  * and avoid function signatures here
* Errors and recovery (alert, page reload, as well as error messages)
  * have them do something really awful, like convert the background color
    to black - all the text will become invisible, but you can REVEAL white
    text that tells them not to panic
* jQuery docs, and how to read them
* intro some of the vocabulary, passim
* Variables
  * declaration, naming
  * 'undefined'
  * SyntaxError illegal ("in my browser it looks like this. it might look a
    little different in yours.")

<!--
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALREADY INTRODUCED....
.addClass(), removeClass, hasClass
.html()
applying a jquery function to an entire selector - use same example.
"arguments"
"return"
$j(this)

Then you can take their definitions out of the functions page (or phrase them
as review)

test all the examples (again)
