# Intro to programming concepts via jQuery

* Go through topics
* Generate list
* Go through research notes - anything to make sure to do?
* Break down into 1.5-hour-ish chunks

(Can you make the self-paced part feel like iPad games? do one really
easy step, get positive feedback?)

## Topics

* Set up dev environment
  --> TODO: make base HTML file and try out in different browsers; collate
            instructions for dev tools (get from LIS 861)
  * send out advance instructions

* Intro/checkoff needs... ?

I have FOUR sections.
  Guiding principle: try to introduce something in one section which is
  highly relevant in the next - give them the break to internalize/rest a bit,
  then pick it back up.  So intro variables and then use them for data types,
  intro if/then and then use them for loops - and come back Tuesday morning
  putting everything together with functions.

### Session 1
* classroom culture
* dev tools - anyone who doesn't have these set up should use a red sticky
* Selectors, binding, just enough events (only use click for now)
  * and avoid function signatures here
* Errors and recovery (alert, page reload, as well as error messages)
  * have them do something really awful, like convert the background color
    to black - all the text will become invisible, but you can REVEAL white
    text that tells them not to panic
* jQuery docs, and how to read them
* intro some of the vocabulary, passim
* Variables
  * declaration, naming
  * 'undefined'
  * SyntaxError illegal ("in my browser it looks like this. it might look a
    little different in yours.")

### Session 2
* Data types (in javascript, arrrgh)
  * reinforce variables
  * strings, numbers, booleans, arrays; objects?
  * (in python arrays=lists and objects=dicts)
* Booleans and if/then

### Session 3
* Loops (foreach)
  * combine with/reinforce if/then
* Leave some time for feedback

### Session 4
* Functions
  * $j(this)?? highly specialized, but might need it
  * make sure to show examples that use variables, data types, if/then, loops
  * then show examples that put several things together
  * pause frequently for questions
  * have them write their own
  * THIS is where you have lots of examples, and go back to self-paced
  * This is where you need the most TAs
            
### Self-paced intro...
* explain any formatting issues that need to be explained (ideally make
  something such that they don't need to be)
* no copy-paste!!!
* how to do input and see output (including utility functions like alert()
  they may need)
* obsessive sidebar definitions of terms
* throwing intentional errors and modeling error recovery
* data types
* variables
* executing scripts from files
* Booleans
* if/else, and/or, elif
* functions

* terms defined:
  string
  concatenation
  variable
  assignment
  function
  traceback
  data type
  argument
  float
  comment
  boolean
  code block
  return
  function signature
  
### Checkoff
  --> TODO: what do I want to make absolutely sure they've done before
      proceeding?

### Lecture

* review tutorial material
* lists
  * purpose
  * initialization
  * accessing elements
  * adding, changing elements
  * slicing lists

* loops
  * for
  * if inside for
  * nested for
  * range()
  * while loops
  * infinite loops
  * if inside while
  * break
  
  --> TODO: whoa hey break out control flow first and remove while loops

* dictionaries
  * purpose
  * initialization
  * accessing elements
  * adding and changing elements
  * keys() and values()

* modules

### CodingBat exercises

Wow, this is totally broken. We don't talk nearly explicitly enough about
functions and control flow, even though they are THE big conceptual stumbles.
For jQuery, we also need the intro portion to include selectors/binding.

### Classroom mechanics
Also read HackerSchool rules - you need to define CULTURE. And Medium and
that other essay - send out in advance if you can.

Think about use of sticky notes. And getting some from GWU.
  * "i get it/i need help"
  * end of day feedback
  * name tags??
  
* Set up an etherpad for collaborative notes and have the link readily
  available
  * include a section of commands taught?

* "You shouldn't ever go more than two or three minutes without asking a 
  question"

* think about how to show them the big picture
