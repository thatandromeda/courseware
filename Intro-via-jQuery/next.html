            <h2>Learning more after today</h2>
            
            <p>
              Want to learn more code after today? Yay!  Here are the two
              things that people tell me, over and over, are the most 
              important things:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Projects.</strong> If you're trying to do a real thing
                you care about, you'll be more motivated to stick with it,
                and you'll have more fun. It doesn't matter if it's a work
                project or a personal one, or something you build from
                scratch vs. something you modify &mdash; it just needs to be
                a real thing. Need ideas? I wrote
                <a href="https://thatandromeda.github.io/ltr/">a whole Library
                Technology Report</a> about short programs librarians have
                written to get real-world things done.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mentors.</strong> It's good to have people who can
                answer questions if you get stuck, or show you better ways
                of doing things that you didn't know existed.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In terms of specific learning resources, you know your own
              learning style, so you know what's likely to work for you.
              But here's my take on some widely available options:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>This course!</strong> You can come back to this site 
                for review whenever.  There's also a link to the source
                code for this site at the bottom of every page, so you can
                read the exact code I wrote to make all the effects happen.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Local user groups</strong> vary in how newbie-friendly
                you are, but if you have a good one, they can be very helpful.
                Check meetup.com to see if there's a group near you for a
                language (Python, Ruby, Javascript, etc.) or project (e.g.
                Drupal) you want to learn.  My local Python group has a 
                beginners' table at project nights. Some Python and Ruby
                groups have women-oriented groups which can be very friendly
                (they generally expect either that you are a woman, or that
                you sign up with a female friend).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>O'Reilly books.</strong> O'Reilly books are the sine
                qua non of tech publishing, and your library may already
                have a Safari subscription, giving you access to their
                whole ebook library.  Look for books in the language of
                your choice that are geared toward beginners (if you're
                just getting started) or that have "cookbook" in their title
                (if you need code samples you can adapt for your projects).
                Good options if self-directed learning works for you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>MOOCs.</strong> A popular option, but one I'm
                skeptical of; course completion rates are low, and there
                can be big jumps in difficulty and cryptic feedback. The
                basic content you need is there (and there's at least one
                library-specific module on Codecademy), but the MOOC route
                works best if you have a close friend who can answer lots
                of questions, or if you sign up together with a whole study
                group.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Formal classes.</strong> A good option for a lot of
                people, though maybe only workable if you can get some time
                at work to do your homework (and maybe some funding to cover
                tuition). Better support than MOOCs. Often fairly abstract,
                though, and not specific to library use cases; they'll give
                you foundations you can apply to lots of things, and make
                it much easier to self-teach later, but you may be on your
                own for building the bridge between the class and your
                real-world applications.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In terms of programming language choice &mdash; honestly 
              this should not be your major question. Languages all
              involve the same core concepts; if you solidly master one,
              a second will be dramatically easier to learn. People definitely
              have languages that play more or less to their personal tastes,
              but for the most part any language is fine. Your choice of
              where to start should be dictated by the projects you see
              yourself working on. For instance...
            </p>
            
            <p>
              If you want to do <strong>text mining, MARC batch processing,
              or data cleanup</strong>, Python is a good choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're a <strong>web design</strong> geek, more jQuery and
              Javascript will be relevant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hacking on <strong>WordPress and Drupal</strong>? Do PHP.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using, or contributing to, library open source projects like
              Hydra, Blacklight, Koha, or Evergreen? Do their language.

            <p>
              Didn't quite get hang of things, and need time to catch up?
              Think you got it, but want more practice so it sticks?
              Loved the exercises and want some additional challenge?
              These are all great, and you're in the right place.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Start at whichever step looks like the right place for you,
              and feel free to move around the room to sit with other people
              working on the same steps.

              You probably won't finish everything on this page, and that's

            <h3>Step 2: extend the examples</h3>
            
            <p>
              One great way to expand your programming skills is to take
              something you've already written and make it just a little bit
              better.  What does "better" mean? Could be lots of things! For
              example:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Easier to read (clearer variable and function names;
                explanatory comments; simpler logic, if possible)
              </li>
              <li>
                Able to handle more edge cases
              </li>
              <li>
                Better at responding to errors
              </li>
              <li>
                More general: able to handle a wider variety of inputs and
                situations
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              So, let's extend some work you've already done. Here are some
              ideas.
            </p>

            <!-- begin functions redux -->
            <p>
              From the <a href="functions.html">functions page</a>:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Write a function that makes <code>#trigger-1</code> 
                change the buttons to purple if they're yellow, and then
                change back to yellow if they're purple.  (You can do this
                with the functions you've already encountered; you might
                also try writing it with <code>toggleClass()</code>. Check
                out the jQuery documentation (linked from the bottom of the
                page) for details.
              </li>
              <li>
                Write a function that makes <code>#trigger-1</code>
                change every <em>other</em> button purple.  This is the kind
                of logic that comes up a lot in web development (e.g. where
                you might want to color every other line of a table). A few
                things you will need to know for this:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You'll need to define a counter variable which you set 
                    equal to 0, and then add one to it every time through the
                    loop.  (This counter variable idiom is super common in
                    programming, too.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Assuming your counter variable is named
                    <code>counter</code>, then <code>counter % 2</code>
                    will return 0 if <code>counter</code> is even and 1
                    if <code>counter</code> is odd. (For those of you who
                    like math: <code>%</code> is the modulus operator, so
                    <code>x % y</code> is x mod y.  If you don't like math,
                    don't worry; you don't need to understand this
                    parenthesis for your program to work.)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- end functions redux -->

            <!-- begin loops redux -->
            <p>
              From the <a href="loops.html">loops page</a>:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                (not yet written. sadface!)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- end loops redux -->

            <!-- begin conditionals redux -->
            <p>
              From the <a href="conditionals.html">conditionals page</a>:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Handle ISBNs a bit better. Don't just flag things missing
                an "ISBN:"; also flag things that have an ISBN that can't
                be valid.  There are a lot of rules governing ISBN validity
                (and if you want to really do this right you'll need to
                learn <a href="http://regexcrossword.com/">regular
                expressions</a>), but one quick-and-dirty rule for now is that
                ISBN-13s start with 978 or 979.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- end conditionals redux -->

          </div>
          <!-- end step 2 -->

          <!-- begin step 3 -->
          <div>
            <h3>Step 3: make new stuff!</h3>
            
            <p>
              Here are some new challenges that build on what you've seen
              before. These problems don't have one right answer, and that's
              fine! Remember, it's generally easiest to build the smallest
              thing you can get working first, and expand from there. 
              You'll also be happiest if you write your code in a text
              editor and copy-paste it into your browser for testing.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Below, there's a longer, dirtier set of book data than what 
                we've seen before. Write a program to flag problematic records.
                (What does "problematic" mean? Read the data and decide
                for yourself.  In the real world, you'd probably have a 
                much larger data set and you'd read a sample of it.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Make <a href="http://library.minlib.net/search/">my public
                library's catalog</a> look better. Those
                <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> elements serving as headers -
                wouldn't they be nicer with a different font and a larger
                font-size? That navigation bar with the languages - can
                we increased the contrast between the text and the
                background color for better accessibility?  What do
                <em>you</em> think would help?  Some things to know here:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Because you can't write a new stylesheet and add it
                    into the page source, you'll need to use jQuery's
                    <a href="https://api.jquery.com/css/">.css()</a>
                    function to change how elements are styled rather than
                    adding and removing classes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You will have to read the HTML source of the document,
                    or use your developer tools, to figure out which 
                    selectors to bind your functions to.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This challenge is particularly well-suited to teams whose
                    members have complementary skillsets. If you have one 
                    person who's strong in jQuery, another who's good with 
                    HTML and CSS, and another with excellent design sense, you
                    can do killer work. (Most real-world tech projects of
                    any size are team projects, in part for this reason.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You <em>can</em> use this technique to make your own
