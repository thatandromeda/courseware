            <h3>Step 2: extend the examples</h3>
            
            <p>
              One great way to expand your programming skills is to take
              something you've already written and make it just a little bit
              better.  What does "better" mean? Could be lots of things! For
              example:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Easier to read (clearer variable and function names;
                explanatory comments; simpler logic, if possible)
              </li>
              <li>
                Able to handle more edge cases
              </li>
              <li>
                Better at responding to errors
              </li>
              <li>
                More general: able to handle a wider variety of inputs and
                situations
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              So, let's extend some work you've already done. Here are some
              ideas.
            </p>

            <!-- begin functions redux -->
            <p>
              From the <a href="functions.html">functions page</a>:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Write a function that makes <code>#loop-trigger-1</code> 
                change the buttons to purple if they're yellow, and then
                change back to yellow if they're purple.  (You can do this
                with the functions you've already encountered; you might
                also try writing it with <code>toggleClass()</code>. Check
                out the jQuery documentation (linked from the bottom of the
                page) for details.
              </li>
              <li>
                Write a function that makes <code>#loop-trigger-1</code>
                change every <em>other</em> button purple.  This is the kind
                of logic that comes up a lot in web development (e.g. where
                you might want to color every other line of a table). A few
                things you will need to know for this:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You'll need to define a counter variable which you set 
                    equal to 0, and then add one to it every time through the
                    loop.  (This counter variable idiom is super common in
                    programming, too.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Assuming your counter variable is named
                    <code>counter</code>, then <code>counter % 2</code>
                    will return 0 if <code>counter</code> is even and 1
                    if <code>counter</code> is odd. (For those of you who
                    like math: <code>%</code> is the modulus operator, so
                    <code>x % y</code> is x mod y.  If you don't like math,
                    don't worry; you don't need to understand this
                    parenthesis for your program to work.)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- end functions redux -->

            <!-- begin loops redux -->
            <p>
              From the <a href="loops.html">loops page</a>:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- end loops redux -->

            <!-- begin conditionals redux -->
            <p>
              From the <a href="conditionals.html">conditionals page</a>:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Handle ISBNs a bit better. Don't just flag things missing
                an "ISBN:"; also flag things that have an ISBN that can't
                be valid.  There are a lot of rules governing ISBN validity
                (and if you want to really do this right you'll need to
                learn <a href="http://regexcrossword.com/">regular
                expressions</a>), but one quick-and-dirty rule for now is that
                ISBN-13s start with 978 or 979.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- end conditionals redux -->

          </div>
          <!-- end step 2 -->

          <!-- begin step 3 -->
          <div>
            <h3>Step 3: make new stuff!</h3>
            
            <p>
              Here are some new challenges that build on what you've seen
              before. These problems don't have one right answer, and that's
              fine! Remember, it's generally easiest to build the smallest
              thing you can get working first, and expand from there. 
              You'll also be happiest if you write your code in a text
              editor and copy-paste it into your browser for testing.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                Below, there's a longer, dirtier set of book data than what 
                we've seen before. Write a program to flag problematic records.
                (What does "problematic" mean? Read the data and decide
                for yourself.  In the real world, you'd probably have a 
                much larger data set and you'd read a sample of it.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Make <a href="http://library.minlib.net/search/">my public
                library's catalog</a> look better. Those
                <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> elements serving as headers -
                wouldn't they be nicer with a different font and a larger
                font-size? That navigation bar with the languages - can
                we increased the contrast between the text and the
                background color for better accessibility?  What do
                <em>you</em> think would help?  Some things to know here:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Because you can't write a new stylesheet and add it
                    into the page source, you'll need to use jQuery's
                    <a href="https://api.jquery.com/css/">.css()</a>
                    function to change how elements are styled rather than
                    adding and removing classes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You will have to read the HTML source of the document,
                    or use your developer tools, to figure out which 
                    selectors to bind your functions to.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This challenge is particularly well-suited to teams whose
                    members have complementary skillsets. If you have one 
                    person who's strong in jQuery, another who's good with 
                    HTML and CSS, and another with excellent design sense, you
                    can do killer work. (Most real-world tech projects of
                    any size are team projects, in part for this reason.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You <em>can</em> use this technique to make your own
                    catalog look better, even if you can't alter its HTML,
                    as long as you can insert some javascript (and ideally
                    a link to an additional stylesheet) somewhere on the
                    page.  <a href="https://github.com/gvsulib/360Link-Reset">Here's
                    a real-world example.</a>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Heck &mdash; make <em>your</em> catalog look better.
                Or if you're frustrated by the limitations of your
                third-party software, make yourself feel better by doing
                horrible things to it with jQuery. That's cool too.
              </li>
            </ul>
