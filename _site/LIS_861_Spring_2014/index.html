<h3>Welcome and objectives</h3>

<p>
  Howdy and welcome! While this course is formally "Information Architecture",
  I think of it as "Help! My organization has a web site (and I might end up in
  charge of it)".
</p>

<p>
  In one semester, I can't hope to make you experts in all the things you might
  need to know to build and manage a web site &mdash; especially since it's
  always changing! However, you will know what domains you'll need to learn more
  about if you find yourself running a real-world web site; the vocabulary for 
  talking with domain experts; and where to go to learn more.
</p>

<p>
  This course addresses UW SLIS <a href="http://www.slis.wisc.edu/ProgramLevel_LOs.htm">
  program level learning objectives</a> 3a, 3c, 3d, 4a, 4b, and 4d.  For details, 
  see the table in the Program Level Learning Objectives section, below.

  semester; during and immediately after travel I may be slow to reply.  My
  travel dates:

  <li><em>Online Northwest</em>, February 6-8</li>
  <li><em>Texas Library Association</em>, April 7-11</li>
</ul>

  If you will be at any of these, I'd love to meet you; drop me a line.

<li>Introduce yourself in the Introductions forum, and read your classmates’ and instructor’s introductions.</li>

<li>Make sure you have a text editor. If you don’t (or don’t know what a text editor is or how it differs from a word processor), install one, using the “Installing a text editor” instructions above.</li>

<li>Make sure you can edit and save an HTML file in a text editor and view it in your browser. If you don’t know how to do this, read <em>Head First HTML</em>, Chapter 1.</li>

<li>If you’ve followed the text editor instructions, read Chapter 1, and you still can’t edit and save an HTML file and view it in your browser, <em>ask questions ASAP.</em> You can ask anonymously in the help forum if you prefer.</li>

<li>Make sure you know where to find developer tools in your browser. <em>If you cannot do this, ask questions ASAP.</em></li>

<li>If any unfamiliar terms or concepts in Zeldman are unfamiliar to you, ask questions in the Unfamiliar Terms? thread of the Week 1 discussion forum.</li>

<li>Answer the other questions in the Week 1 discussion forum.</li>

<li>We’re all in this together, so make sure your classmates’ questions get answered. If you know the answers already, great. If you don’t, use your ninja-like reference skills to help find answers (don’t forget to explain your search strategy!).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a <em>reference work</em>, so you don’t need to read it comprehensively. Instead, skim it (especially the Getting Started page) to learn what your options are, and then solidify your understanding by building a basic Bootstrap page from one of the templates and the available CSS components. (You don’t need to use the JS components now, although if you were familiar with HTML and/ or programming before the course, they’re a good way to extend your knowledge. We’ll come back to them.)<br />If you haven’t read a lot of tech documentation before, here’s how: pick one component. Then either read about in-depth and then build it, or build and then read its documentation in more depth as needed – whichever style works better for you – going back and forth between reading and building until the component works. The documentation may not make total sense until you’ve built the thing, and that’s okay.</p>

<p>Reply to a post (not your own) in last week’s Your jQuery Effect thread as follows (pick one):</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a post with a script (whether it works or not). Describe what you believe the script is doing, step by step, in English, and ask the original author if that’s accurate. (If you’re the original author, please tell them if they’re right! If they’re not, explain what you were going for. As a bonus, this may help you understand errors in your code.)</li>

<li>Find a post where someone wants help improving the script and help them out. If you know exactly what to do, go ahead and explain it or write the code. If you don’t, that’s fine too - ask some questions that will help them clarify their thinking, or find some resources that you think might help them get on the right track, or explain the half you do know how to solve and ask for help on the half you don’t.</li>
</ul>

<p>Iterate your jQuery from last week. If it wasn’t working, try a new strategy (get something simpler to work, ask for help and go from there, etc.) If it was, make it do something more complicated. Post about it to last week’s ‘Your jQuery Effect’ thread.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="./assignments/one_pager.html">final project one-pager</a> and <a href="./assignments/final_project.html">final project deliverable</a> assignments. There’s a Final Projects thread in the Content Browser &gt; Course-wide info area you can use to ask questions, propose ideas, and find teammates.</p>

<p>Discuss the Week 7 discussion forum threads.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can do lots of cool stuff with JS, but possibly at a cost: e.g. making sites slower to load, or less accessible to users who have screenreaders, or who have disabled JavaScript. Progressive enhancement is the idea that the bare-bones version of your site (no JS, no CSS) should <em>work</em>, providing access to all the core content and functionality; styling and interactivity are layers on top of that which enhance the experience for other users. This article discusses some of the techniques for doing that.</p>

<h3>Course policies</h3>

<p class="bold_red">
  I wish to fully include persons with disabilities in this course. Please let me 
  know within two weeks if you require accommodation. I will try to maintain the 
  conﬁdentiality of this information.
</p>

<h4>Academic honesty</h4>
<p>
  I follow the academic standards for cheating and plagiarism set forth by the 
  University of Wisconsin.
</p>

<p>
  I consider myself personally bound by the 
  <a href="http://www.hmc.edu/studentlife1/honorcode.html">honor code of my 
  undergraduate college</a>, which states that I am "responsible for maintaining 
  [my] integrity and the integrity of the college community in all academic 
  matters and in all affairs concerning the community."  While you are not bound 
  by this, I encourage you to act in a way that reflects well on yourself and the
  institutions you represent.
</p>

<h4>Be the protagonist of your own technology adventure</h4>

<p>
  An explicit goal of this course is self-suﬃciency in acquiring knowledge about 
  novel technology. To that end, I will NOT handhold you through every technology 
  we look at. You are expected to exhaust normal information channels (google,
  documentation and help menus for software, trial and error, etc.) before you 
  approach classmates or (especially) me with nuts-and-bolts technology 
  questions.
</p>

<p>
  Because we come to this class with a wide range of technology backgrounds, you
  may find some of the course material is not novel for you.  I encourage you
  to approach me with alternative assignment proposals that will push the 
  boundaries of <em>your</em> technology skills.  I am happy to suggest things
  you might wish to learn next, based on where you are now.
</p>

<h4>Assignments</h4>

<p>
  Our course week, for convenience, runs from Monday to Monday beginning January 
  21 (so the ﬁrst week is a day short). All assignments will be due on Mondays by 
  midnight Central, with the exception of the assignments due immediately before
  spring break and during finals week; these are due on Friday. Late assignments 
  will be penalized one ﬁnal-grade percentage point per day or fraction thereof 
  late.  If some catastrophe befalls you and you must negotiate alternatives, 
  contact me <em>before the due date</em>; lenience is at my sole discretion.
<p>

<p>
  If this catastrophe affects your group project, <em>contact your colleagues as
  well</em>.
</p>

<p>
  I do not offer extra credit.
</p>
<h3>Program Level Learning Objectives</h3>

<p>
  This will be elaborated as assignments become available.
