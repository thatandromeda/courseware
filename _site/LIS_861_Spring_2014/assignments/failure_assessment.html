        <h3>Overview</h3>
        
        <p>
          Fail interestingly. Learn from it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In life and in technology, we rarely do anything perfectly, and that's
          okay.  Getting outside our comfort zones &mdash; going to places where
          we <em>don't</em> already know the map &mdash; is what lets us develop
          new skills and become more awesome.  Failing isn't a problem.  <em>Not
          learning</em> from failing is the problem.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Keep track of what goes wrong over the course of the semester: a new 
          tool you can’t get your head around, a piece of software you didn’t use 
          right, a blind alley on your ﬁnal project, a stance you took during 
          class discussion (or believed beforehand) that you now know is wrong.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Turn in a single-page reflection that characterizes your most 
          interesting failure; reflects on what you learned; and outlines a
          strategy for doing better in future.  This strategy may be specific
          (what could you do to better solve this kind of problem) or general
          (how can you demonstrate better persistence, creativity, communication,
          resilience, or whatever else was needed).

          Fake Grimlock</a> also has lots of helpful things to say about failure,
          iteration, and winning.
