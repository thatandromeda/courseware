<h5 id="assignment">Assignment</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Introduce yourself in the Introductions forum, and read your classmates’
and instructor’s introductions.</li>
  <li>Make sure you have a text editor. If you don’t (or don’t know what a text
editor is or how it differs from a word processor), install one, using the 
“Installing a text editor” instructions above.</li>
  <li>Make sure you can edit and save an HTML file in a text editor and view it in
your browser. If you don’t know how to do this, read <em>Head First HTML</em>, Chapter 
1.</li>
  <li>If you’ve followed the text editor instructions, read Chapter 1, and you
still can’t edit and save an HTML file and view it in your browser, <em>ask 
questions ASAP.</em> You can ask anonymously in the help forum if you prefer.</li>
  <li>Make sure you know where to find developer tools in your browser. <em>If you 
cannot do this, ask questions ASAP.</em></li>
  <li>If any unfamiliar terms or concepts in Zeldman are unfamiliar to you, ask 
questions in the Unfamiliar Terms? thread of the Week 1 discussion forum.</li>
  <li>Answer the other questions in the Week 1 discussion forum.</li>
  <li>We’re all in this together, so make sure your classmates’ questions get
answered.  If you know the answers already, great. If you don’t, use your
ninja-like reference skills to help find answers (don’t forget to explain
your search strategy!).</li>
</ul>
