<li>Answer the other questions in the Week 1 discussion forum.</li>

<li>We’re all in this together, so make sure your classmates’ questions get answered. If you know the answers already, great! If you don’t, use your ninja-like reference skills to help find answers (don’t forget to explain your search strategy!).</li>
