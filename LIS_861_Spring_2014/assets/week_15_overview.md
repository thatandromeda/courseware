## Stakeholders and buy-in: Overview
Stakeholders want different things.
They may not know the things you know about technology and user experience.

      the super short overview

Buy-in is the *continual process* of communicating your vision in a way that
makes people want to be a part of it.  It's not just something you do at the
beginning of the process and get sign-off on once.

Coral Sheldon-Hess, web services librarian at the University of Alaska-Anchorage,
has graciously agreed to share with you some of her strategies for getting
buy-in.  (Keep an eye out for ideas you've already seen in this course!)  Take
it away, Coral...

## Buy-in as a process
Mita's talk blockquote
  "The one thing that surprised me when I made the transition from science 
  librarian to UX librarian, was the realization of how much work user experience 
  work demands continual education of best practices to one's peers. It is only 
  recently that have realized that I have not done enough of it."

Buy-in begins before any specific project, when you educate your coworkers and
supervisors about technology. Mita Williams and Matthew Reidsma have talked
about continuous, public user testing as a means of educating your coworkers.
Coral Sheldon-Hess talked about running a book group with her web team where they 
learned how to step into their perspectives as web users - which in turn made them 
much more receptive to her arguments about how students use the web, too, and what
that meant for their own web site.

Sheldon-Hess also wrote a document [Coral's doc] where she advanced her vision for 
the web site. Do you see Krug's influence? Do you see how a project one-pager 
would fit with the web plan?  What other ideas about usability and project 
management do you see in this document?

Buy-in continues throughout projects, too.  
[http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/8741] shows how to plan for an ongoing and
_two-way_ communications process.  Communicating about your progress toward 
meeting the requirements agreed on at project launch helps people see your value 
and trust that you're using your autonomy well.  But it also allows for 
miscommunications and requirements changes to be surfaced, leading to a better 
product. Do you see how using an agile project management methodology facilitated 
communication in this example?

## Problems you may encounter

[http://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ital/article/view/1768/1673] researches
types of problems that people might encounter in getting support for their library
tech projects. Do you see evidence of coercive, mimetic, or normative forces in 
Sheldon-Hess's buy-in document - either that she is using to gain buy-in, or that 
she is pushing back against to advance her web site vision?

[http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/4944] is a good summary of the problems
I've heard my library technology colleagues rant about time and time again -
albeit with fewer swear words. (This stuff can be really frustrating!)  Note
also that it echoes what we saw last week about the importance of aligning 
yourself with organizational goals.  Library technologists tend to interact
with multiple audiences - they face both nonlibrarian IT audiences and 
nontechnical library audiences, and the most effective ones can speak both those
languages fluently, and explain each to the other, and their own work to both.

And finally, RFPs.  Library technology projects often launch with a Request
For Proposals: a document that outlines the library's requirements and invites
vendors to bid on solving them.  And RFPs are terrible.
[http://collaborativelibrarianship.org/index.php/jocl/article/view/279/228]

Why are RFPs terrible?
* People often copy-paste language from other libraries' RFPs, without
  necessarily understanding what those requirements were for or whether they
  are relevant. These requirements may additionally be very out-of-date.
* They don't have space for projects to change as people discover problems with
  the initial requirements, unexpected costs, or better ways of doing things.
* They're not a collaborative, two-way process! Look at the one-pager: it
  requires sign-off from both the project's users and its implementers. This means
  that they've had to _have a discussion_ at some point about what matters and 
  why. They've had to talk about the costs of different options and how to 
  balance those against priorities. They've had the chance to clear up 
  miscommunications.
  
When I do software contract work, developing a one-pager, and maybe even
prototyping a solution, is a crucial part of my work.  It's my chance to make
sure I understand what the clients really want - something they may not be
able to articulate before they've seen some examples. It's how I make sure
we have the same vision in our heads. And it's my opportunity, as the software
expert, to gently educate the client about why their first ideas might not be
the ones they'll be happiest with: to tell them about hidden costs, or about
alternatives they may not have heard of.

RFPs short-circuit this whole process.  You're probably stuck with them because
they're such a common way for libraries to acquire software, but they're
terrible, and you need to know that.

## A closing example

The Meadville library is a small, rural public library that does open source
development.  In reading [http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/7939], I want
you to read between the lines for how they communicated.  Do you see how their
projects involved clear requirements; constant, two-way communication; lots
of technology education for both the technologists and their coworkers; and
management support?  Can you envision, based on their writing style and project
timelines, what their communications process must have looked like, and how
it helped them gain and keep buy-in as their project requirements changed?
