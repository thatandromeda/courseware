Library web sites suck.

No, really. Ask anyone who does UX in libraries. They'll tell you.
(They'll cringe.)

My personal theory?  Librarians often think in *nouns* - information. We love
information! We want to give people information!  We want to give people ALL
the information.

But web site users act in verbs. What can I do here? How do I do it?

They want it to be obvious, or they get frustrated and go away and don't
discover the cool nouns *and* verbs they can do at your library.

This week we're going to read, in Krug, about some of the basics of the
usability perspective. What do usability experts see when they look at a web
site? Why do they see it?

And we're going to read about how this way of thinking applies to library web
sites -- or could.  Along the way there are some hints of why it doesn't.
Keep an eye out for themes we'll see more of later in the course: accessibility,
project management and stakeholders and buy-in.

I have a couple pieces of paper taped to the wall behind my desk, to remind
myself of the important things when I write code.

You can substitute "patrons" for "clients" -- it works just as well.  What
problems does your web site solve for your patrons? What do they show up needing
to do, and how do you make it clear, even delightful, how they do it? Can you
solve problems they didn't even know they had?

Your library web site has a ton of features.

You do a lot of cool stuff.  But telling your patrons lots of facts about it? 
Doesn't solve their problems. Getting out of the way of their *doing stuff* lets 
them solve their own problems, through you.

The two-sentence takeaway?  Your web site shouldn't be about your library's nouns.
It should be about your patrons' verbs.
