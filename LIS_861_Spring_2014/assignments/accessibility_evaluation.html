        <h3>Overview</h3>
        
        <p>
          Evaluate your web page from Assignment 1 for accessibility errors and 
          fix any problems.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In particular, you will...
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Make sure your pages have valid HTML. (They already should from
            Assignment 1, so hopefully you get this for free! But make sure to
            validate your code again after you've made any changes you need to 
            make as a result of the other tools.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure your pages don't have any errors according to 
            <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure your text has adequate color contrast with its background.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigate around your page using only the tab and cursor keys (i.e.
            no mouse or trackpad). Make sure this works.  (If you're using a Mac,
            there's a <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/08/14/enable-tab-key-navigation-safari/">setting
            you may need to change</a> first.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Run your page through the screen reader emulator at
            <a href="http://webanywhere.cs.washington.edu/beta/">WebAnywhere</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why do we do this?</h3>
        
        <p>
          The goals of this assignment are:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            To familiarize you with tools that help you evaluate web accessibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            To help you see the web from a different perspective: are there
            design decisions and coding habits that work for you, but exclude
            others?
          </li>
          <li>
            To give you a chance to iterate your code (since pretty much all
            code everyhere needs to be iterated).
          </li>
          <li>
            To give you practice in fixing accessibility errors, including
            identifying specific techniques that promote accessibility.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          But <em>why</em> do we do this? Because the code you write, and your
          library's digital presence, should welcome everyone, not just the
          currently able-bodied.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            The URL of your web site.
          </li>
          <li>
            One to two pages reflecting on the results of the checks, what you 
            learned, and any changes you made.  Make sure to address keyboard 
            navigation and the screen reader experience; feel free to address 
            anything else of interest.
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
          Some of these accessibility checkers will only work for pages on the
          internet, not files on your computer, so upload your Assignment 1
          web site somewhere (your UW web space, or anywhere else you have access
          to).  Run the checkers, change whatever you need to, and make sure
          to upload the improved version - that's the URL you'll be submitting.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Grading criteria</h3>
        
        <p>Your web site must...</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            Validate for XHTML or HTML5, using <a href="http://validator.w3.org">
            validator.w3.org</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not have any errors in <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a>.
            (Alerts are okay.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Have sufficient contrast between text and background according to
            <a href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">this Web Content 
            Accessibility Guidelines checker</a>.  (If you have more than one
            text/background color pair, all should pass the checker.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Your reflection must...</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be well-written and well-organized.
          </li>
          <li>
            Draw on specific examples from your code and the tools we used...
          </li>
          <li>
            ...and tie them to larger ideas about accessibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            Include your thoughts on whether keyboard navigation and the screen 
            reader worked for your site, and describe any changes you made as
            a result of these tests.
          </li>
        </ul>
