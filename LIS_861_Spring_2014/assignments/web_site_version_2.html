        <h3>Overview</h3>
        
        <p>
          Improve your web site from Assignment 1.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
      
        <h3>Why do we do this?</h3>
        
        <p>
          Iteration is an important part of all software. It's never bug-free
          the first time -- and even if it were, often you discover important
          things about what your users need only after you deploy your code.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Plus which, of course, this is a chance for you to practice your
          skills and improve anything you weren't happy with the first time, 
          or have reconsidered in light of what you've learned since.
        </p>

        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            Your HTML file (one page is sufficient);
          </li>
          <li>
            Your custom stylesheet(s);
          </li>
          <li>
            Any images, scripts, or other assets your page needs to work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reflective writing (up to 2 pages) discussing changes you made to 
            improve information architecture, usability, or accessibility.  What 
            did you change and why?
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
          Turn these in as a zip archive (make sure when I unzip it, the links 
          from your HTML file to your stylesheet and assets will still work!). 
          Turn your zip file in to the appropriate Learn@UW dropbox.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The paragraphs can be in any format I can easily read. Text, PDF,
          .doc, HTML are all fine.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Grading criteria</h3>
        
        <p>Your page must...</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            Meet all the criteria for Assignment 1. (If anything didn't validate,
            this is your chance to fix it!)
          </li>
          <li>
            Pass all the checks from the accessibility assignment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Include a Javascript effect (jQuery, Bootstrap, or your own custom
            code is fine, so long as it works).
          </li>
          <li>
            Demonstrate the changes you discuss in your reflective paragraphs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your reflection must...</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            Demonstrate an awareness of ways to improve your original site;
          </li>
          <li>
            Thoughtfully ground that awareness in concepts from the course.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Your sites are all different, so it's up to you whether you think
          the highest-priority improvements relate to organization, usability,
          design, writing for the web, et cetera. I'm looking for you to make
          logical choices, based in your analysis of concepts we've learned.
          Particularly strong reflections will ground that analysis in specific
          examples from our readings.
