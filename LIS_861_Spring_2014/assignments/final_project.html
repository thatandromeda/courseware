        <h3>Overview</h3>
        
        <p>
          Propose a redesign for a library web site, grounded in an analysis
          of its users, goals, strengths, and weaknesses. Prototype your
          proposal. Deliver both your proposal and your prototypes as web pages.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This is a group project; your group can divide the labor in any way
          that seems fair to you.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why do we do this?</h3>
        
        <p>
          A library web site redesign is a common, and daunting, real-world task
          which relies on all the skills we've discussed in this course. Proposing
          one will let you practice those skills (as a bonus, these skills are
          applicable all over web work, not just in the redesign context).
          Getting your feet wet with the redesign process now will also make it
          more approachable should you be involved in one professionally.
        </p>

        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        
        <p class="bold_red">Due May 16.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            Your report, analyzing the existing site and proposing changes;
          </li>
          <li>
            Your protoype, consisting of two pages: a home page and an internal 
            page, exemplifying the changes you are proposing.
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
          Both of these should be web pages: HTML, plus whatever CSS and JS you 
          need to demonstrate your vision.  Deploy these, whether to UW My 
          WebSpace or externally, and provide the links in the Deliverables
          thread of the Final Project forum at Learn@UW.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Grading criteria</h3>
        
        <h4>Report content</h4>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            What is the site you're redesigning?
          </li>
          <li>
            Who are the site's users? (Think in terms of demographics, but also
            personas: what do people want to do here?)
          </li>
          <li>
            What are the site's goals? (What content does it - or should it - 
            provide access to; what interactions does it - or should it - 
            facilitate.)
          </li>
          <li>
            How should the site be organized to achieve those goals?
          </li>
          <li>
            Is it usable? As part of your analysis, actually test the usability of 
            a component, following the examples this term of quick, cheap testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Is it accessible? As part of your analysis, test its accessibility with
            one of the tools we've discussed this semester.
          </li>
          <li>
            What does the site do particularly well or badly?
          </li>
          <li>
            What are your recommendations?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You may organize this content in any way you like, so long as it
          reflects good use of HTML organizational elements (e.g. headers) and
          best practices for web writing as described in Krug (e.g. be concise).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Your recommendations should be clearly grounded in evidence and in 
          concepts you've learned this term, and should address the issues
          of users, goals, strengths, weaknesses, etc. covered elsewhere in
          your report.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Prototype content</h4>
        
        <p>
          Your prototype should clearly demonstrate your recommendations.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Since this is a prototype, there are some things that won't work, and 
          that's fine.  Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if applicable need to work, 
          and your page does need to be fully styled. However, there are some 
          things that can't work because they rely on content you don't have 
          access to or that doesn't exist. Thus, for example...
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            If your prototype has a catalog search, show me exactly what that 
            should look like, but I don't expect it to perform searches.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your prototype's navigation should reflect the areas you think the 
            redesigned site should have, but the links need not work as the linked 
            pages may not exist.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Technical requirements</h4>
        
        <p>
          Both your report and your prototype are web sites, and as such should...
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            Validate for XHTML or HTML5, using <a href="http://validator.w3.org">
            validator.w3.org</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be without errors per <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a>. 
            It's okay if there are alerts (though I will give you a bonus point
            if there are no alerts).
          </li>
          <li>
            Be responsively designed (for phone/tablet/desktop).
          </li>
        </ul>
