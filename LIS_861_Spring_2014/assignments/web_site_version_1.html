        <h3>Overview</h3>
        
        <p>
          Create a responsive web page with handcoded HTML & CSS.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The page may have whatever topic and design you like.  You may use
          Bootstrap or another framework as a base for your design (in fact, you
          are encouraged to), but you must also include a hand-coded custom 
          stylesheet (typically named <code>custom.css</code>) which overrides 
          your base framework to individualize your design.  Make sure you link 
          to this page <em>after</em> linking to your base framework so the styles
          will cascade properly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          You do not need to demonstrate artistic talent, but your page does
          need to have a neat, professional appearance.  Think of dressing for
          a job interview: not everyone has a great fashion sense, but everyone
          can put on a clean, well-ironed suit.  If you have a flair for design,
          feel free to show it!  If you don't, override an existing framework with
          a light hand, taking advantage of the design resources we discuss in 
          this course.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Why do we do this?</h3>
        
        <p>
          Knowing HTML and CSS will enable you to make small overrides to your
          web sites, social media themes, catalogs, etc. without needing to ask 
          for help.  It will also give you an understanding of what's possible
          (useful in advocating for your organization's tech goals!) and why we 
          use higher-level frameworks (CMSes, Bootstrap, etc.) to let us get more 
          and higher-quality work done in less time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Having these skills will give you the context for understanding the
          rest of this course. In addition, we will use this page as a base to
          iterate on for the web site version 2 assignment.  In the real world,
          tech projects often start with a minimum viable product and then 
          iterate as we discover bugs and our users' actual needs, so we're going
          to follow the spirit of iteration here, too.
        </p>

        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            Your HTML file (one page is sufficient);
          </li>
          <li>
            Your custom stylesheet(s);
          </li>
          <li>
            Any images, scripts, or other assets your page needs to work.
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
          Turn these in as a zip archive (make sure when I unzip it, the links 
          from your HTML file to your stylesheet and assets will still work!). 
          Turn your zip file in to the appropriate Learn@UW dropbox.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Grading criteria</h3>
        
        <p>Your page must...</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            Validate for XHTML or HTML5, using <a href="validator.w3.org">
            validator.w3.org</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be responsive, with breakpoints for phone, tablet, and desktop
            sizes (in bootstrap3 these are 480px, 768px, and 992px, plus you
            get a large-desktop version for free).  I <em>strongly recommend</em> 
            you use Bootstrap or another framework to achieve this, but you are 
            welcome to hand-code all your CSS if you prefer.  The content and
            layout may change at each size, but should be presentable and
            coherent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be clearly organized, via headers, subheaders, and/or nested divs,
            as appropriate to your content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Include at least one link, image (properly attributed, with alt text),
            header, paragraph, and list (either ordered or unordered is fine,
            as appropriate to your content).
          </li>
          <li>
            Include a relevant and clear comment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Link to an external stylesheet in the <code>head</code> &mdash; no
            inline styles!
          </li>
          <li>
            Use divs, not tables, for layout. (Tables are permitted if you have
            genuinely tabular data to display, but may not be used for overall
            layout.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If you are using Bootstrap or another framework, you must...</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            Serve from a CDN.
          </li>
          <li>
            Demonstrate thoughtful use of built-in framework classes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Your custom stylesheet must...</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            Demonstrate element, ID, and class selectors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use at least five distinct CSS properties &mdash; your choice which.
            Not sure which to try? The properties I find myself using most often 
            are <code>font-family</code>, <code>font-weight</code>, <code>color</code>, 
            <code>background</code>, <code>margin</code>, and <code>padding</code>.  
            (Sometimes I use them in more specific forms, like 
            <code>background-color</code>, <code>padding-top</code>, 
            <code>margin-left</code>, etc.)
          </li>          
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          If you are looking for additional challenge, try one of the following:
          pin your footer to the bottom of the page, so that the page always
          stretches to at least the height of the browser; do a 2-column layout
          where both columns stretch the full height of the page (use different
          backgrounds so you can see that they have); apply CSS transitions;
          use the Bootstrap Javascript components.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I take for granted that all work in this course will show solid English
          writing mechanics, and will penalize if it does not.
