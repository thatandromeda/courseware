######Required
Read the Week 6 reading in Learn@UW (available in the Content Browser sidebar), 
containing the How To Read Documentation video and the What is the DOM explanation.

Post your questions and/or reflections on the Lynda video in the relevant thread
of the Learn@UW Week 6 forum.

Read the documentation at [api.jquery.com](http://api.jquery.com) for [.slideToggle()](http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/),
[.addClass()](http://api.jquery.com/addClass/), [.removeClass()](http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/),
[.toggleClass()](http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/), [.css()](http://api.jquery.com/css/)

Add an effect to your HTML page from Assignment 1 with jQuery, and tell us
about it in the relevant thread of the Week 6 forum.
> It can be any effect you like, and the page doesn't have to look good when
> you're done; the goal is to make it _work_.  If you aren't sure where to start, 
> use .toggleClass() on something that has a class already.

process interesting.
