title: Week 4 (Feb 10-Feb 16) &mdash; Bootstrap and Responsive Web Design
---
#####Key questions
> What is responsive web design and why do we care?

> What are some of the differences _besides styling_ that go into designing for
> mobile? What problems does responsive web design solve, and what problems
> _doesn't_ it solve?

> How do you apply Bootstrap's CSS elements to a web site and perform basic
> customizations?

> How does RWD fit into the big picture of usability? (We'll come back to this
> later.)

#####To read/watch
__Required__

[Responsive Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design)  

> _The_ foundational article for RWD: this is where it got started.

[Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/)  

> This is a _reference work_, so you don't need to read it comprehensively.
> Instead, skim it (especially the Getting Started page) to learn what your
> options are, and then solidify your understanding by building a basic Bootstrap
> page from one of the templates and the available CSS components. (You don't
> need to use the JS components now, although if you were familiar with HTML and/
> or programming before the course, they're a good way to extend your knowledge.
> We'll come back to them.)  
> If you haven't read a lot of tech documentation before, here's how: pick one component. Then either
> read about in-depth and then build it, or build and then read its documentation
> in more depth as needed -- whichever style works better for you -- going back
> and forth between reading and building until the component works. The 
> documentation may not make total sense until you've built the thing, and that's
> okay.
