#####Assignment
* Introduce yourself in the Introductions forum, and read your classmates'
  and instructor's introductions.
* Make sure you have a text editor (install one if necessary).
* Make sure you can edit and save an HTML file in a text editor and view it in
  your browser. _If you cannot do this, ask questions ASAP._
* Make sure you know where to find developer tools in your browser. _If you 
  cannot do this, ask questions ASAP._
* If any unfamiliar terms or concepts in Zeldman are unfamiliar to you, ask 
  questions in the Unfamiliar Terms? thread of the Week 1 discussion forum.
* Answer the other questions in the Week 1 discussion forum.
* We're all in this together, so make sure your classmates' questions get
  answered.  If you know the answers already, great! If you don't, use your
  ninja-like reference skills to help find answers (don't forget to explain
  your search strategy!).
