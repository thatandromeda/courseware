Krug reading

Definitely:
Ch 1-3, 5
7 on homepages - a fraught thing in libraries (different title in 3rd ed, but
same basic content, looks like)

8, 9 on testing

make sure to look through the index

Nope
4
11 accessibility - probably superseded by better things
6 for information architecture?? (only if during IA week) (so no; let's find

10 reservoir of goodwill (it's Ch 11 in the 3rd ed)
