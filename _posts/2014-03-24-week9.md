What are your goals for this week?
Later: scenarios & personas; testing & tools; accessibility. So this week is not
those things.
"features are not benefits"

The elements of user experience (garrett) - available?

O'Reilly's Designing Interfaces - you know, I probably want it for myself, though
it sounds too specific for this use

Similarly for me: Set Phasers on Stun: And Other True Tales of Design, Technology, 
and Human Error by Steven Casey

have already had them read Schmidt & Etches, pp 60-71 (the sections on content audit and content workflow)

one and do something with it)
