Look for:
Jenica's ppt on meetings
Ken's chapter on planning a migration, or similar
An agile overview (Rosy may find you a good one)

Rosy's talk:
Rosy will talk about meetings - ways that people do it wrong and how you can
do it better. It can link out to lots of concepts, like status reports. Agile
perspective.

Follow-up questions:
appear.in or similar is fine -- need to think about pros and cons
collated questions by email is fine too

Notes:
Tie into organizational change - changing meeting styles can be disruptive.
Look ahead to stakeholders & buy-in.
Rosy will send me some readings.

Varnum and Schmidt & Etches may both have relevant chapters to place on reserve.
