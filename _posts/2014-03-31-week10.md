Questions

ideas...
Who uses your web site? What do they want to do there? How do you know?
How can you distill this knowledge into something that helps you make decisions?

Questions:
in your preferred library type,
what distinct user categories can you identify? what do you THINK their
different needs/wants/pain points might be? what are some web site elements
you think would be beneficial in serving those needs?  how could you tell if 
you're right?

What are the benefits of personas?

What are some things you could do to develop a high-quality persona? 

What are potential risks if you rely on personas that aren't high-quality?

Readings:
Ethics. You'd better be sure you're not confusing what you want with what your
users want.

looking ahead to stakeholders: the things that they want aren't necessarily
the things your users want: https://xkcd.com/773/
