title: Week 3 (Feb 3-Feb 9) &mdash; CSS basics
---
#####Key questions
> How do I add styling to an HTML file with CSS?

> How can I learn the basics of good web design, even if I'm not a designer?

> What are some of the deeper concepts that web design can provoke us to think about, and what can we learn from them about how to build better web experiences?

#####To read/watch
######Required
[What Screens Want](http://frankchimero.com/what-screens-want/)

Zeldman, Ch. 9, 10, 12, 13 (just the first section, "On Typography")

[design seeds](http://design-seeds.com/) and [Adobe Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/)
> If you have a great sense of color, you can skip design seeds, though you might find it fun anyway.  
> Kuler will help you generate reasonable color schemes if you don't have a strong
> color sense; even if you do, you might find the hex codes useful.

[Google webfonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts)
> Play around with this: search for some fonts that might be good for headers
> and for body text, add a few to your collection, and make sure you know where
> to copy-paste the code you need to use them.

######Optional
[The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web](http://webtypography.net)

_The Non-Designer's Design Book_
> As a non-designer, I found this book VERY illuminating and empowering; it lays
> out simple rules you can use to make good choices even if you don't have an
> instinct for art.

_The Design of Everyday Things_
> A genuine classic of design and user experience that will change the way you
> see the world around you. Worth reading for its notion of "affordances" alone.
  
_Literary Machines_
> A weird, quirky, brilliant book unlike anything you've ever read. The
> origin of hypertext. Available on campus at UW; may be hard to find elsewhere,
> but it's worth ILLing.

[Useful CSS](http://miriamposner.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/usefulcss.pdf)
> A helpful cheat sheet for the CSS you'll use most often.

[Less](http://lesscss.org/) and/or [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
> If you're comfortable with CSS, and especially if you've run into headaches
> trying to maintain stylesheets for large sites, these will change your
> whole workflow, and it'll be great. Bootstrap, which we'll see next week, is
> Less-based.

Zeldman, Ch. 11
> Read if you're interested in what's up with doctype declarations, the details of 
> browser incompatibility, the history behind these things, and why designing for 
> earlier Internet Explorer versions will make you want to pull your hair out.
