Note: both Ranti and Cynthia say that making sure you followed accessibility
guidelines does NOT mean your site is usable.

Make sure to go back and reread their emails.

Cynthia:
My take is that the following things must be checked, and the tools you use are a matter of preference. All of the ones Ranti recommended are good choices. I've just listed what I personally use.

1. Pages should always validate (this is the most basic thing). I use w3c's validator [8] .
2. General structure. Use WAVE toolbar's Outline view, text-only view.
3. Colour contrast. I use Firefox's WCAG Contrast Checker. (Any contrast checker is prone to false positives though, because of the ability to layer elements.)
4. Keyboard accessibilty. The "tab" key is your friend! On a Mac, you need to change the settings to get the proper behaviour in a browser [9]
5. Screen reader emulation. I use Firefox's Fangs because I prefer to scan/read. When I used to have a Mac, I would also use VoiceOver to double check some things.
