Answer the card sorting question in the forums. Come back later and
see how your classmates answered it; respond to something you find 
thought-provoking.

Answer one of the following in the Evaluation thread in the Week 8 Discussion
Forum:

* The articles "Avoid Category Names That Suck", "Where Am I?", and "Home Page Goals" 
  each give some concrete criteria for evaluating a web page's information
  architecture.  Pick whichever article you found most interesting, and evaluate a
  library web page according to those criteria. (Any library is fine.) Tell us 
  about it.
* Pick an idea from this week and go to the UW library catalog to learn more about
  it. Keeping in mind Kuhlthau's ideas and the techniques you've seen this week:
  what did you encounter that helped your process of selection, exploration, 
  formulation, and collection?  What hindered it?  Did anything particularly
  increase, or decrease, either your uncertainty or your anxiety?  Tell us about 
  it.
