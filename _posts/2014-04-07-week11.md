Questions
Pick one of the testing tools we learned about this week. What are three
questions you *could* answer with this tool? What about three questions you 
*couldn't* answer?

Look at a library web site and identify 3 usability questions you'd like to
answer about it.  What tool(s) would allow you to answer those questions? If
those tools found problems, what are some specific changes you could make in
response, assuming your data supported those changes?
