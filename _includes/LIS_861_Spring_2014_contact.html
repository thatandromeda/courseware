  Please use exhaust your information resources (the Learn@UW help forum, google,
  software documentation and help files, trial and error, etc.) before emailing 
  me; please also do your best to assist your colleagues.  In my experience, 
  students can usually help one another better than teachers can!
</p>
<p>
  Otherwise, email me.  I will try to respond to your emails within two business 
  days.  However, I will be traveling to several library conferences this 
  semester; during and immediately after travel I may be slow to reply.  My
  travel dates:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>ALA Midwinter</em>, January 23-28</li>
  <li><em>Online Northwest</em>, February 6-8</li>
  <li><em>Texas Library Association</em>, April 7-11</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you will be at any of these, I'd love to meet you; drop me a line.
